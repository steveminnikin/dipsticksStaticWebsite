                            <p>We have been calibrating storage tank volumes and manufacturing dipsticks for over 35 years and
                                over that time we have built up a vast reserve of expertise and data. Indeed if you have
                                an existing tank there is a very good chance we already hold the records for it.</p>
                            <p>Whether your tank is <em>Horizontal Cylindrical with Dished Ends</em>, <em>Vertical with Dished Base</em>,
                                <em>Rectangular</em> or even <em>Elliptical</em> we have the technical know-how and experience

                                such as the <em>Knuckle Radius</em> of the dished end, the addition of a <em>Striker Plate</em>                                and the requirement to place the tank on a tilt.</p>

                    <p>A quick search of the Internet will reveal numerous programs which claim to compute the volume of storage
                        tanks and whilst they are correct for theoretical models of storage tanks none of them take in to
                        account real world manufacturing elements which affect the volume of the tanks such as:</p>
                    <ul class="list-unordered">
                        <li>Dished Ends have a <em>Knuckle Radius</em> so that they can be attached to the cylindrical portion
                            of the tank
                        </li>
                        <li>Tanks are fitted with a <em>Striker Plate</em> to prevent the dipstick wearing out the bottom of
                            the tank after repeated dippings</li>
                        <li>Tanks are often tilted to separate any particulate matter from the point of siphoning</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We account for all of these factors and more! The result being that you can have absolute confidence
                        in the accuracy of your readings</p>
